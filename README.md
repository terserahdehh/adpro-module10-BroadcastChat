1. I run the server with 

`` cargo run --bin server ``

and the client with 

`` cargo run --bin client ``

The server listens on port 2000 for websocket connections and immediately sends a welcome message when a client connects. Any line entered in a client is sent to the server, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients. Each client prints every broadcast message it receives.

2. I changed the listening address in server.rs from  
``TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:2000") `` to  `` TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080") `` and in client.rs I updated the ``Uri::from_static("ws://127.0.0.1:2000")`` to ``Uri::from_static("ws://127.0.0.1:8080")``

 After restarting server and clients they still connect and exchange messages on port 8080. Both sides use the same ws:// websocket protocol, which is set in the clientâ€™s URI and handled by ``ServerBuilder::new().accept(socket)`` on the server. Everything runs smoothly with the new port.
